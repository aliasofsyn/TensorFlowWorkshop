Overview
This project uses a neural network implemented with TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9) and is a popular dataset for testing image classification models.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, split into:

Training set: 60,000 images
Test set: 10,000 images
Each image is 28x28 pixels, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.

Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps applied to the dataset include:

Normalization: The pixel values are scaled from [0, 255] to [0, 1] for faster convergence.
Shuffling and Batching: The training data is shuffled and split into batches of size 128 to improve training efficiency.
Model Architecture
The neural network model consists of:

Input Layer: Flattens the 28x28 images into a 1D array of 784 features.
Hidden Layer: A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons (representing digits 0-9) and no activation function, as we use the from_logits=True setting in the loss function.
Model Summary
python
Copy code
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
Training
The model is trained using:

Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001
Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy (suitable for integer labels)
Metrics: Accuracy
Training Command
python
Copy code
history = model.fit(
    dataset_train,
    epochs=8,
    validation_data=dataset_test
)
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and test datasets:

python
Copy code
results = model.evaluate(dataset_test)
The training results showed an improvement in both loss and accuracy over the epochs, indicating effective learning by the model.

Results
Training Accuracy: Achieved ~98.9% accuracy after 8 epochs.
Validation Accuracy: Achieved ~97.7% accuracy after 8 epochs.
The learning curve is visualized using Matplotlib to show training and validation accuracy across epochs.

Learning Curve
python
Copy code
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.legend(['Train', 'Validation'], loc='best')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
Usage
To make a prediction using the trained model:

python
Copy code
def random_prediction():
    img, label = list(dataset_test.take(1))[0]
    img = tf.reshape(img, (-1, 28, 28, 1))

    prediction = model.predict(img)
    processed_prediction = tf.math.argmax(prediction[0])

    print("Predicted Label:", int(processed_prediction))
    print("Actual Label:", int(label))
    plt.imshow(img[0,:,:,0], cmap="gray")
    plt.show()

Notes
If you encounter warnings or errors related to TensorFlow datasets caching, consider restructuring your input pipeline as suggested in the warning message.
For optimal performance, make sure you are using a system with a GPU, as training deep learning models can be computationally expensive.
